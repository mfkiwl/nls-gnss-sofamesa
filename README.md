# NLS GNSS SOFAMESA
*Do you ever compare the performance of different GNSS receivers or Network-RTK methods (VRS, PRS, MAC, MAX, i-MAX, FKP etc.) before investing into one? How do you validate the performance of a GNSS receiver or a Network-RTK method in reality? You can use this software for those purposes.*

SOFAMESA analyses GNSS measurement files. See example report produced by SOFAMESA: [Comparison of five methods](90M9180_10_Visits_Conclusions_Measurement_Report.pdf)





**Updates & changes 2019-9**
*  If all data was filtered out, program resulted in error. Now if all values are filtered, vectors with 'None' are created 
*  Added different possibilities on filtering results: on true reference coordinates; on median of ALL measurements; on median of FIXED measurements. See NLS_GNSS_SOFAMESA.ipynb
*  Gaussian distribution -plots disabled
*  Minor changes on statistics table fields

**Requirements:**

*  Windows Operating System
*  Free access through firewall
*  The test data should consist of at least 3600 measurements per reference point. Is the requirement met? For example, with 10 seconds measurement time and 1 second epocs, averaged solutions should be 3600 pcs. Does the file consist of at least 3600 measurements for the point?
